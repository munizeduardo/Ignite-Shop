## How to use

This application uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)'s API to proccess payment and register products. On checkout, in order to successfully place an order, you should only input test cards from their [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) in order to protect your personal information.

In order to successfully place an order, you should input:
```
- An e-mail with valid format, it doens't necessarily have to exist, but if it does, it won't be emailed. (i.e. john@doe.com)

- Card information should be filled with a valid test card from Stripe's documentation. (i.e. 4242 4242 4242 4242). Expiration date should be any future date, and CVC any 3 numbers.

- Name on card can be any name, note that it's the name that'll appear on success page after order is placed. (i.e. John Doe)
```

It's important to note that you should refrain from using real information on these fields as these will be stored in Stripe's dashboard in order to register orders.
